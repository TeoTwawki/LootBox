It reads files stored by Final Fantasy XI in the USER folder containing a local copy of your inventory.\r\n\r\nThe current version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/TeoTwawki/LootBox/releases).\r\n\r\nTo run LootBox, you will need the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328).\r\n\r\nTo [build LootBox yourself](https://github.com/TeoTwawki/LootBox), you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or later. The free version will work just fine for this. The 2015 edition also works, though it may want to upgrade the toolset which can change the edition of Visual C++ Redistributable Package required to run the resulting executable file.\r\n\r\nUpon first launch, LootBox should automatically detect the installation path of Final Fantasy XI from the registry. If this fails, you will be asked to pick it manually.\r\n\r\nIf the interface is still empty after all that, open the INI file and verify the FFXiPath value.\r\nThe correct path should lead to the directory which contains the USER folder, such as:\r\n`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PlayOnline\\SquareEnix\\FINAL FANTASY XI`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
